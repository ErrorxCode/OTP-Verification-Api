***This is an easy-2-use API for implementing OTP verification in your app. You don't need to write boilerplate code for requesting or verifying the code.
  Just need to call respective method with 2-3 arguments and rest the library will manage. The main + point of this API is that it does not require internet to run, instead
  it requires sim subscription to send sms. Only the - point is that, it will add 2 more permission to your manifest :(
  One for sure is of SEND_SMS and another RECEIVE_SMS if you use auto-verification.***. 

#### Pros & Features:
- Your personal server, thus it will be only used by you.
- Free, Fast & Genuine
- It doesn't even require internet

**Note: This api is used on the basis of a assumption that, the user has at least one sim with active subscription**.


#### Usage:
```java

```

## Implimentation
Add maven to your root build.gradle
```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
Add the dependency
```
dependencies {
	    implementation 'com.github.ErrorxCode:OTP-Verification-Api:Tag'
}
```
