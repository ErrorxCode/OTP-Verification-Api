***This is an easy-2-use API for implementing OTP verification in your app. You don't need to write boilerplate code for requesting or verifying the code.
  Just need to call respective method with 2-3 arguments and rest the library will manage. The main + point of this API is that it does not require internet to run, instead
  it requires sim subscription to send otp***.

## Pros & Features:
- Your personal server So, No limit, No bandwidth.
- Free, Fast, lightweight & small in size (only 9.72 KB)
- It doesn't even require internet

***The only con is that***, this library will add few permission to your manifest, SEND_SMS for sure and other 2 (RECEIVE_SMS and READ_PHONE_STATE) depends on your needs.

**Note: This api is based on a assumption that, the user has at least one sim with active subscription**.


## Implimentation
Add maven to your root build.gradle
```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
Add the dependency
```
dependencies {
	    implementation 'com.github.ErrorxCode:OTP-Verification-Api:Tag'
}
```

## Usage:
First make sure your app has the following permission :- 
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS" />		// Required to use this library
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" /> 	// Only, if you use requestVerificationImplicit()
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS" />  	// Only if you use startAutoVerification()
```
**To send verification code to user** :
```java
PhoneVerification.requestVerificationImplicit(this, "92148xxxxx", new OnCodeSentCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccessful(String OTP) {
                // OTP is the code which is successfully sent
            }

            @Override
            public void onFailed(VerificationException e) {
                // OTP is not sent, hence we need to see the reason
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
```

You can also use `PhoneVerification.requestVerificationExplicit()`. The only difference is that, Explicit one will show a promt to select the sim if there is no default sim set for sending sms, While Implicit will automatically use the 1st sim.`

**To verify the OTP** :
```java
PhoneVerification.verifyCode(otpView.getText().toString(), new OnVerifyCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccessful() {
                // Verification successful, OTP match !
            }

            @Override
            public void onFailed(VerificationException e) {
                // Verification failed, we need to see the exception
            }
        });
```
You can also use `PhoneVerification.startAutoVerification()` to automatically verify the code. **Note that, this method must be called befour requesting verification code**.
