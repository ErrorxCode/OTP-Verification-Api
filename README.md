# **OTP Verification Library**

***Most Easiest & lightweight library you had ever seen. Now verify Email's / Phone using this API. Just one line & you are all done, Although this API has some limitation***. 


### Pros
- Lightweight, hence easy to use
- Free & No account needed
- 3 Backup servers, in case of emergency or quota reached.
- Require Almost zero knowledge, just one word to wright.
- Open source, hence anyone can contribute

### Cons / Limitations 
- You can request OTP via mail only limited number of times per day
- SMS Verification is only for Android users.
- The server will only accepts limited no. of OTP request made via email. doesn't matter who is using it, it will be counted by the server for everyone ü§ê

***I will fix these issue in next release, if I get enough support***.

            @Override
            public void SentSuccessful(String OTP) {
                // Store this OTP in a Variable
            }

            @Override
            public void SentFailed(MessagingException e) {
                // handle this error and show error message to user
